## Summary
The notebooks presented, as well as the model weights presents everything needed to run your own quantization experiments and training an SSDLite model using the [cow detection dataset from ICAERUS](https://zenodo.org/records/10245396).

## Installation:
You can choose to install everything in a Python virtual environment or directly run a jupyterlab docker:


##### Option A: Setup through Docker:
This starts a premade jupyter environment with everything preinstalled, based around a nvidia docker image for DL support.
* Linux/Ubuntu:
  ```bash
  docker run --rm -it --runtime=nvidia -p 8888:8888 --gpus 1 --shm-size=5gb --network=host -v /path_to_local/dir:/home/jovyan jurrain/drone-ml:gpu-torch11.8-uavgeoformers
  ```

`--network=host` flag whether you want to run it on a different machine in the same network, and want to access the notebook. (does not run locally)

`-v` flag makes sure that once downloaded, it stays in that folder, accessible from the PC, and when restarting, all the weights etc. remain in that folder. `path_to_local/dir` is thew path to your working dir where you want to access the notebook from. can be `.` if you already `cd`ed into it.

` --runtime=nvidia` can be skipped when working on WSL2



* Windows requires WSL2 and NVIDIA drivers, WSL2 should also have the nvidia toolkit (for deep learning)
